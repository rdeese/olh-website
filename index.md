*<center>"Once old Lazarus heard the sound, he couldn't put the harp string down..."</center>*

Old Lazarus' Harp is a rag-tag collective of some of the best young traditional folk musicians in Chicago. OLH
celebrates a spectrum of local acts playing traditional styles, from old-time and Irish, to son jarocho, blues, cajun
and more. The collective regularly puts on concerts, jams, hootenannies and square dances throughout the city's alleys,
homes, halls and bars--including the now-annual Midwest Sing & Stomp and Maypole Folk Festival.
